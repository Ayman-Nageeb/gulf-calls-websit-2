        Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is a good measure
        of atherogenic triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) which are highly
        prevalent in patients with diabetes mellites (DM). There is a strong
        association between the levels of atherogenic TRLs and the increased
        risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A number of regional and
        international guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C as primary or
        secondary therapeutic target especially in patients with very high CV
        risk like CVD or DM. The aim of this study is to assess the long-term
        association between the triglyceride levels and the achievements of
        non-HDL-C in patients with very high CV risk patients (DM or CVD) in the
        Arabian Gulf Countries.
