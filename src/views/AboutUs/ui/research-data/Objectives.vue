      <h2>Primary Objectives:</h2>
      <p class="text-justify title"> 
        To estimate the long-term association between changes in TG levels and
        the achievements of non-HDL-C in patients with very high CV risk (DM or
        CVD), who are on statins alone or statins with other lipid lowering
        treatments (LLTs) and with controled LDL-C in the Arabian Gulf
        Countries. The non-HDL-C CV risk-based target goals will be according to
        the ESC/EAS 2011, 2019 and ESC 2021 guidelines.
      </p>
      <h2>Secondary Objectives:</h2>
      <p class="text-justify title"> 
        <ol>
          <li>
            To estimate the long-term association between TG levels and CV events (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, cardiac catheterization, all-cause mortality). 
          </li>
          <li>
            To assess the physiciansâ€™ perception and clinical practice patterns on the management of patients with high TG levels and the use of non-HDL-C as CV risk-based target goals.
