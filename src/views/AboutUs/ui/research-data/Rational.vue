        In the Arabian Gulf countries there are no data assessing the following situations:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The long-term impact of changes in triglyceride (TG) levels and the achievements of non-HDL-C CV risk-based target goals in patients with very high CV risk.
            </li>
            <li>
                The long-term association between changes in TG levels and cardiovascular (CV) events.
            </li>
            <li>
                The physiciansâ€™ knowledge and practice toward the management of very high CV risk patients with high levels of TG and the use of non-HDL-C as CV risk-based target goals in such patients.
            </li>
        </ol>
        This study will help to identify a patient population that is potentially at high residual risk for future CV events, improve the quality of care for such patients and improve the adherence of physicians to implement lipid guidelines recommendations in their clinical practice.
