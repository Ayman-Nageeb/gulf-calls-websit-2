        the achievements of non-HDL-C in patients with very high CV risk (DM or
        CVD), who are on statins alone or statins with other lipid lowering
        treatments (LLTs) and with controled LDL-C in the Arabian Gulf
        Countries. The non-HDL-C CV risk-based target goals will be according to
        the ESC/EAS 2011, 2019 and ESC 2021 guidelines.
